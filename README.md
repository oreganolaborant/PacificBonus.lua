# PacificBonus.lua

A Lua Script for YimmenuV2 that gets you 12mil by doin the Pacific Standard Heist.

I´ve made this Script myself and Ive just got into coding so if something doesnt work tell me in [Issues](https://github.com/oreganolaborant/PacificBonus.lua/issues)

---

# How To Use?

1. Press Win+r then type in %appdata% and open it.

2. Then Search for the YimmenuV2 Folder and Put the PacificBonus.lua into the Scripts Folder.

3. Then just start the Game normally and inject the YimmenuV2

4. When youre loaded in go to the Planning Board and Start the Heist with the Script running. (If youre solo turn on Play All Missions Solo under Recovery-Main in the ModMenu)

5. When you see the Map at the bottom left Corner you can click on Instant Finish (Pacific) in the Mod Menu.

6. Sometimes you will get a Transaction Error but you should still get your money. If not then stay in the Heist for a bit like drive to the Bank and kill the 2 Guards and then click on Instant Finish.

7. And thats all you have to do!

8. (Important: I wouldnt do this more than once every 60 minutes)
